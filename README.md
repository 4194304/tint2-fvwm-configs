A great looking config for FVWM and Tint2 that is very similar to KDE in terms of its layout.

The screenshot shows everything laid out in its true form (it isn't tiling it's stacking!)

The screenshot on the right shows two terminal windows. The top window shows the amount of RAM being used after a starting X, and the lower window shows the amount of RAM used when all the apps shown in the screenshot are open.

It was a bit frustrating to configure FVWM especially, but overall I'm quite happy with it!

If you want to try this yourself, simply copy the config files in the zip file into your home directory.
